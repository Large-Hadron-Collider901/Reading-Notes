# Professional Competency Self-Assessment


 ## Top Three Strengths:

* Handling Ambiguity- I believe this is one of my greatest strong suits due to the nature of my upbringing. Although my childhood was deeply traumatic, I truly believe that in navigating through those experiences, I developed some important skills pertaining to handling ambiguity. Growing up in an evironment in which uncertain, chaotic and volalile situations were the norm meant that if I wanted to make it out of there someday and build a future for myself, I would have to learn how to be successful (in school, work, etc) no matter the circumstances. Chhange has been a reoccuring theme throughout my life, so I have had a lot of practice in the area of learning how to adapt. Despite how challenging it was to perservere and maintain a positive attitude throughout that time in my life, it has also been a really rewarding experience. The lessons and skills that I have learned through this journey are surely some of my greatest assets.

* Root Cause Relsolution- Another area I excel in is root cause resolution. In my opinion, this is one of my strongest proficiencies because for me, problem solving is less of a 'skill' and more of an instinct. I am naturally very inquisitive and I typically avoid jumping to conslclusions. I know that problems are complex and there is usually much more to consider than what we can see on the surface. 

* Curiosity- This area is also one of my strongest proficiencies because curiosity often leads to some of my greatest discoveries and learning opportunities. As a matter of fact,my curiosity is actusally what lead me to finthe Code Collective Academy! One morning I was looking at local news online to see what's going on in the community and I came across an article with the title "memphis organizations offering program for young adults looking to learn coding" on wmcactionnews5.com and I was so excited to read about that oppurtunity! I filled out the application and that is why I'm here today! :-)
