# Professional Competency Self-Assessment <br>


## Top Three Strengths:

Handling Ambiguity- I believe this is one of my greatest strong suits due to the nature of my upbringing. Although my childhood was deeply traumatic, I truly believe that in navigating through those experiences, I developed some important skills pertaining to handling ambiguity. Growing up in an environment in which uncertain, chaotic and volatile situations were the norm meant that if I wanted to make it out of there someday and build a future for myself, I would have to learn how to be successful (in school, work, etc.) no matter the circumstances. Change has been a reoccurring theme throughout my life, so I have had a lot of practice in the area of learning how to adapt. Despite how challenging it was to persevere and maintain a positive attitude throughout that time in my life, it has also been a really rewarding experience. The lessons and skills that I have learned through this journey are surely some of my greatest assets.

Root Cause Resolution- Another area I excel in is root cause resolution. In my opinion, this is one of my strongest proficiencies because for me, problem solving is less of a ‘skill’ and more of an instinct. I am naturally very inquisitive and I typically avoid jumping to conclusions. I know that problems are complex and there is usually much more to consider than what we can see on the surface.

Curiosity- This area is also one of my strongest proficiencies because curiosity often leads to some of my greatest discoveries and learning opportunities. As a matter of fact, my curiosity is actually what lead me to finding the Code Collective Academy! One morning I was looking at local news online to see what’s going on in the community and I came across an article with the title “Memphis Organizations Offering Program for Young Adults Looking to Learn Coding” on wmcactionnews5.com and I was so excited to read about that opportunity! I filled out the application and that is why I’m here today! :-)

## Top Three Weaknesses:

Speaking- Although I am a decent writer, my speaking skills could definitely use a lot of improvement. Usually, if I take the time to practice speaking ahead of time I tend perform better. However, I also need to learn some coping mechanisms for calming my nerves while speaking so that I can grow in that area. If I can find ways to reduce my anxiety related to professional speaking, I believe I could really enhance those skills.

Dependability and Reliability- This is another area that I need improvement in due to the fact that I sometimes struggle to complete projects in a timely manner. Whenever I am overwhelmed because I'm stuck on a problem, I tend to tell myself I can figure it out on my own. This makes he situation even more stressful as time starts to close in on me. One way I can improve my dependability and reliability is to schedule tutoring sessions so that I don’t waste so much time being stuck on a problem. That way I can address anything im not understanding right away after class and I will have more time to actually work on the assignment as well as turn it in on time.

Planning and Estimating- An additional area that I see room for growth in are my planning and estimating abilities. I have a habit of underestimating the amount of time it will take me to complete a task. This is usually because I typically assume that I wont run into any complications that will cause delays, which can really be a detrimental mistake when it comes to planning. Here are some examples of how I can improve my planning and estimating skills: <br>
-Identify critical tasks <br>
-Arrange tasks in a logical order <br>
-Establish priorities systematically differentiating between urgent, important and unimportant tasks <br>
-Use a “to do” list, task plan, or similar planning devices to note action plans <br>
-Monitor and adjust priorities and eliminate tasks on an on-going basis
