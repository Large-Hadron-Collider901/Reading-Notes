# Dynamic Web Pages With JavaScript

## JavaScript Basics:

* JS is best known as a scripting language for web pages although it has many other uses as well
* JS is **Prototype-based programming** which means this type of style allows the creation of an object without first defining it's class 
    - Object = data structure containing data and instructions for working with the data
    - Class = defines an object's characteristics, consists of an objects properties and methods
* Allows you to implement complex things on web pages
* Add interactive features to your website 
*Here are some examples of what JS can do:
    -games
    -dynamic styling effects
    - animation






























console.log("Hello World"); 
console.log("Skye")

* variable is a container that stores data in javascript

var x;//variable declaration
x = 20;//variable assignment

console.log(x);//prints out the value stored in x

var myNaifme = "Skye";

console.log(myName);

var myage = 24;

var userage = prompt("Enter your age here");

var myage = 24,

console.log(userAge);

if (conditional statement){
    add code here
}

if (userAge <= 10){
    alert("You need parental permission to use this website")
}


if(userName == "Charlie"){
   var userName = prompt ("What is your name?);
   if(userName == "Charlie"){
       alert("Good Luck Charlie");
   }

   document.write("Welcome ")
