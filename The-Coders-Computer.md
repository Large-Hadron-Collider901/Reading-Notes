## What Is A Text Editor? ##
A text editor is an important developer tool which allows you to write and modify code

## Types of Text Editors ##
* **Built-In Text Editors:** Basic text editors that come with your computer such as "Notepad" for Windows or "Text Edit" for Mac. These text editors can be insufficient because they lack some important features that are pretty essential for writing code.
* **Third-Party Options:** These text editors must be downloaded and installed on to your computer. They offer a variety of features that are widely used in web development. Some examples of third party text editor software include Notepad++, Text Wrangler, BB Edit, Visual Studio Code, Atom,
Brackets, and Sublime Text
* **Integrated Development Environment (IDE):** An IDE differs from a text editor because it is actually a suite of different software coming together in one environment. An IDE combines several components including a text editor, a file manager, a compiler and a debugger in to one package. 

## Features ##
What features are important in a text editor?

1. **Code Completion:** Saves *a lot* of time by displaying suggestions as you type and by closing any tags, brackets, or quotations for you when you open them
2. **Syntax Highlighting:** Organizes your text and makes it easier to read by colorizing the text 
3. **Themes:** Allow you to customize the appearance of your page by giving you the option to select a colors for the background of your text editor and to choose the series of colors in your text
4. **Extensions:** Optimize your experience by allowing you to accomplish more with mininmal effort. Extensions act like plug-ins for your text editor

## The Command Line ##

The command line (or terminal) is a interface system where you can enter commands and recieve feedback to those commands.

## The Shell, Bash ## 

The shell is a component within the terminal that is part of the operating system which defines how the terminal behaves and executes commands for you. Bash (Bourne Again Shell) is the most common shell. You can use the **echo** command to display a system variable stating your current shell.

## Shortcuts ##
* The 'up' and 'down' arrow keys can be used to fetch commands from your history
* To edit these commands, the 'left' and 'right' arrow keys can be used to move the cursor where you want
