# Dynamic Web Pages With JavaScript

## JavaScript Basics:

* JS is best known as a scripting language for web pages although it has many other uses as well
* JS is **Prototype-based programming** which means this type of style allows the creation of an object without first defining it's class 
* JS Allows you to implement complex things on web pages
* Add interactive features to your website 
*Here are some examples of what JS can do:<br>
   -games <br>
   -dynamic styling effects <br>
   -animation <br>git 
* An Object = data structure containing data and instructions for working with the data
* A Class = defines an object's characteristics, consists of an objects properties and methods


## Prompting The User:

* An **alert** shows a message and waits for the user to press ok. The window with this messafe is called a *modal window* 
* A **prompt** accepts two arguments, it shows a modal window with a text message, an input field for the visitor, and the buttons OK/cancel
* A **title** is the text to show the visitor
* **Default** is an optional second parameter, the initial value for the input field
* The text that a visitor types into the prompt field is called a **result**
* **Null** is the result we get if the visitor cancels the input
* The function **confirm** shows a modal window with a question and two buttons: OK and Cancel
* The result is **true** if OK  is pressed and false otherwise

## Conditionals:

* The conditional operator is represented by (?)
* Sometimes its called "ternary" because the operator has three operands
<br>
The syntax is:
//let result = condition ? value1 : value2;
* The condition is evaluated: if it's truthy then value1 is returned otherwise, value2
