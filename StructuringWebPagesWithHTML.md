3. Map out user flow

## HTML Basics ##
**H**yper**t**ext **M**arkup **L**anguage is a code used for structuring the content of a webpage

* Elements are used to enclose or wrap different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way

*Parts of an elememt*
* Opening tag: name of the element wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets
* Closing tag: same as the opening tag except it includes a forward slash before the element
* Content: The content of the element which is text
* Element: The opening tag, closing tag and the content make up the element
* Attribute: Contains extra information about the element that doesn't appear in the actual content
* Nesting element: Elements inside other elements
* Empty element: Elements that have no content

## Semantics ##
Semantics refers to the meaning of a piece of code. It assigns a role to the text it wraps around

Ex: 
"<h1>This is a top level heading</h1>"

but this only makes it *look* like a top level heading
"<span style="font-size: 32px; margin: 21px 0;">Is this a top level heading?</span>"
* no semantic value
* no extra benefits

semantic elements:
* <article> 
* <aside>
* <details>
* <figcaption>
* <figure>
* <footer>
* <header>
* <main>
* <mark>
* <nav>
* <section>
* <summary>
* <time>>
