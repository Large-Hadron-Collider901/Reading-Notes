## Loops and Iteration

Loops are a fast way to do something repeatedly. For example in a game where you tell someone to take X steps in one direction and Y steps in another could be expressed as a loop <br>

ex: for (let step = 0; step <5; step++> { 
    //Run 5 imes, with values of step 0 through 4
    console.log('Walking east one step');
}
</br>


## Types Of Loop Statements

* for statement: repeats until specified condition evaluates to false <br>
ex:  for ([initialExpression]; [conditionExpression]; [incrementExpression])
  statement </br>
* do while statement
* while statement
* labeled statement
* break statement
* continue statement
* for...in statement
* for...of statement
