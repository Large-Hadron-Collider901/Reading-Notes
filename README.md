# **About me**
Hello, my name is Skye McCullough! I am a student at The Code Collective Academy, 
entrepreneur, and small business owner. I am breaking into the tech industry from a 
non-traditional background and training to become a software developer! I have a wide
variety of interests such as playing guitar, singing, gardening and jewelry making.
I love to design and create just about *everything* and I am working on building an 
online shop on Etsy where I can share some of those creations with you. Throughout 
the code school course, I will be learning about all of the fundamentals of becoming
an entry-level software developer and this is where you can find all of my notes and 
projects!
