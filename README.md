# About me 
Hello! My name is Skye McCullough. I am a Jill of all trades, master of none.(Yet!) I have worked a variety of different types of jobs in all kinds of settings. Some of my favorite work related experiences include working on a traveling conservation crew, serving at a popular fine dining restaurant/hotel/bar/music venue, and picking black berries! I also have some call center experience where I learned a variety of skills related to customer service, sales, and retention. At this time, I am not currently working, as I would really like to focus most of my energy on my education! In my free time, I am usually working on creating items to sell in my Etsy shop, playing music, listening to music, drawing, or studying. I am currently training to become a software developer at The Code Collective Academy in Memphis, TN. Here are some of the subjects I am studying and projects I am working on:
