**About me** <br>
</br>git 
Hello! My name is Skye McCullough. I am a Jill of all trades, master of none. I have worked a variety of different types of jobs in all kinds of settings. Some of my favorite work related experiences include working on a traveling conservation crew, serving at a popular fine dining restaurant/hotel/bar/music venue, and picking black berries! I also have some call center experience where I learned a variety of skills related to customer service, sales, and retention. At this time, I am not currently working, as I would really like to focus most of my energy on my education! In my free time, I am usually working on creating items to sell in my Etsy shop, playing music, listening to music, drawing, or studying. I am here because I have a creative mind and have always loved designing things! I started my journey with HTML back in the myspace days and it was a lot of fun for me, especially when some of my classmates and friends would pay me to design their pages. I am so excited to get to be a part of the Code Collective team! This program is such incredible opportunity and I feel blessed to be a part of something that is so much bigger than myself and to connect with people in the community who truly inspire me. I know that this class will be challenging at times, but I am a problem-soIver at heart! I find it very rewarding and fulfilling to trouble shoot issues and find solutions to them. I look forward to embarking on this journey with everybody!!
