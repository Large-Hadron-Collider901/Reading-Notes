# What is Growth Mindset?
Growth Mindset is the idea that intellegence and talent are not fixed traits, and that with enough practice, effort, and perserverance, a person can really achieve anything they set their mind to!

## Maintaining a Growth Mindset


### Challenges
-The way we address challenges is a really important part of maintaining a growth mindset
-When we are frustrated, it's easy to get stuck in a fixed mindset 
-A great way to overcome getting stuck in a fixed mindset is to reconginze the signs (giving up, avoiding the problem, telling myself the task at hand is impossible, giving up)
-Take a step back from the task at hand, give yourself time to breathe and walk through the problem again when you feel ready
-Give yourself time to think of new ways to address the issue until you find another way forward
-Talk through the steps outloud
-Jot down clues as they come about in order to begin finding the root cause of the problem

### Obstacles
-Learning how to deal with challenges in a healthy, productive way is also essential to keeping a growth mindset
-When we are faced with obstacles, it can be easy to let ourselves become distracted from what's really important
-In Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, Robert Persig talks about the “gumption trap” – the phenomenon of knowing what needs to be done, but lacking the motivation to do it
-One way we can overcome getting stuck in the "gumption trap" is to walk away from the task and come back when you're feeling more inspired 

### Effort
-In order to truly learn and progress at something, putting in effort is key!
-Sometimes, putting in your best effort can feel exhausting and it can be easy to give in to temptation and self gratification (procrastination, sleeping in)
-One way to overcome this, is to make a consious effort to think about the growth mindset
-Think about the bigger picture. Consider your goals, hopes, and dreams for your future to remind yourself why you do the things you do, even if it is challenging
-Think about how much better you feel when you are actively working towards those goals to motivate yourself to put in your best effort!

### Criticism 
-Another important part of maintaining growth mindset is to review each of your days and assess how you've done
-Asking yourself the following questions is a great way to reflect on all aspects of our day and come up with strategies to create more good days in the future:
     1) What was the best part of the day?
     2) What went wrong, and how can I make sure it doesn’t happen again
-Asking yourslf a variation of these questions can help you to proccess critisizm from co workers:
     1) Which aspects of my work am I most proud of?
     2) What can I do to improve the aspects I’m less proud of?
     
### Success of Others
-Your perception of the success of others can be the difference between staying stuck in a fixed mindset and maintaining a growth mindset
-Where a fixed mindset leads you to see the success of others as a threat, the growth mindset encourages you to see the success of coworkers as an inspiration
-Choosing to be more transparent in conversations with coworkers can help us to adopt the growth mindset concepts to influence peer interactions
