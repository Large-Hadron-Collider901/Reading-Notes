## What is CSS?##

CSS is a language which is responsible for the style, layout, and other presentation features of a document
Here are some examples of how CSS can be used:
* Change color and size of headings or links
* Create a layout- (adding a main content area, sidebars, columns, etc)
* Animation

CSS is a rule-based language
-define rules specifying styles yoiu want to apply to elements or groups of elements

The rule opens with a selector that selects the HTML element it is going to style

EX: <h1> in this case we are styling level one headings 

Next we have declarations which are property and value pairs inside curly brackets {}
 EX: {

    property ---> color: red 
     Font-size: 5em <--- value

 }
