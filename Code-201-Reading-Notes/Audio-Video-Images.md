# HTML Images

```
<img>- this is the element that you will use to
add a image to a page

src- another component of the image element is src,
which tells the browser where to get the image file.


alt- this is where you can provide a text description
of the image which describes the image if you can not
see it


title- you can also use the title attribute to the 
<img> element if you want to provide additional information
about the image. most browsers will display this text
when the user hovers over the image
```
Below, you can see example of the syntax that is used to
add an image to a page in HTML:

```
<img src="your-image-url-here.jpg" alt="A text description of your image goes here" title="Your image title goes here"/>
```

Definitions in this section were derived from Chapter 5: “Images” (pp.94-125)
of the textbook *HTML & CSS Design And Build Websites* By Jon Duckett
