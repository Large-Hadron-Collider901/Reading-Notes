# More CSS Layout

## Container Elements
Container elements are used to group together sections of a page. Some examples of container elements are:
- `<div>`
- `<header>`
- `<footer>`
- `<article>`
- `<section>`
- `<blockquote>`

## Positioning Schemes
In CSS, we can choose from several different positioning schemes that allow us to control the position of elements on a page in order to customize the layout. Here are the types of positioning schemes available:
- Normal Flow (This is the default positioning scheme unless we specify otherwise)
- Relative Positioning
- Absolute Positioning
- Fixed Positioning 
- Floating Elements 

## Fixed Width Layout vs. Liquid Layout
* Fixed width layouts do not change size depending on the user's screen size, measurements usually designed using pixels
* Liquid layouts stretch and contract as the user increases/decreases their screen size, measurements usually designed using percentages

## CSS Frameworks
CSS frameworks are stylesheets that provide code for common tasks such as creating layout grids and styling forms. There are a number of different frameworks available online, and you can include them in your projects rather than writing the code from scratch. Not only will they save you from repeatedly writing code for the same tasks, but they have been tested across multiple different browsers and versions!
Here are some online resources for finding some great CSS frameworks:
