# What Google Learned About Teams

Today in code school we read an article published in *The New York Times Magazine* titled: "What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team" written by Charles Duhigg. Here are some things that I learned regarding what Google learned about teams, as well as some interesting facts I learned in the reading:

* Studies show that when working in groups, people tend to innovate faster, see mistakes more quickly and find better solutions to problems. 
* In addition, people working in groups tend to report higher job satisfaction and achieve better results.
* According to executives in a 2015 study, when workers are persuaded to collaborate more, profitability increases.
* Google's People Operation department found that good communication and avoiding micromanaging were traits shared by the best managers.
* They also learned the most productive employees tend to build larger networks by rotating dining companions.
* Google put together a project named "Project Aristotle" to study Google teams and figure out what made some teams better than others.
* In Project Aristotle, although researchers found that not all good teams behaved in the same way, there were two behaviors that the most successful teams shared:
    - The first behavior successful teams shared was members spoke in roughly the same proportion, which they called "equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking." But if only some members spoke most all of the time, the teams effectiveness declined.
    - The second behavior was that the team members had high "average social sensitivity"- which means they were intuitive about how a person is feeling based on tone of voice, body language, expressions and nonverbal cues. 
* Essentially, the researchers in Project Aristotle found that establishing psychological safety was of the most critical part of creating a successful team.
* The best teams are made up of members who listen to one another and show sensitivity to the feelings and needs of one another.
