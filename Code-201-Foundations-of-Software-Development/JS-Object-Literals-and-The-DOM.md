# JavaScript Object Literals

* In order to create an object, first you must create a variable
* Your variable is where you will store your object
* The object acts like a container for a group of properties
* An object is made up of a set of name and value pairs
(the names are referred to as keys)
* A key is separated from its value with a colon
* Each property and method is separated with a comma but
not after the last value
* The syntax for accessing a property or method using dot notation is as follows: 
objectName.propertyOrMethodName
* The 'dot' is known as 
a member operator because
the property/method is a 
member of the object

* The DOM lets us see the what a webpage's code looks like *before* it's processed by the browser
* Each HTML element is a **DOM note**.
