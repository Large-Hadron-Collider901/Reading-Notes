# Markdown Notes

## What is Markdown?
Markdown is a method of styling text on the web. Here are some examples of how we can control the display of a document with markdown:

  * Formatting Words (Bold or Italic)
  * Adding Images
  * Creating Lists
    
    
## Syntax
Here are some types of Syntax that can be used on Github:

** Headers ** : Can change the size of your text to organize a document into sections 
* Emphasis: Use a single star to write in *italics* , two stars to write in **bold**
* Lists: Use a star write unorganized lists (like this one) or you can number your lists to create an organized list
1. Like this one
2. For example
* Images: Add images using this format [alt text here] (image url here)
* Links: Cope and paste the link and it will automatically format, or use this format [Website name here] {Website URL here)
* Blockquotes: Use the '>' symbol to format quotes
As Jesus once said:> As a man thinketh in his heart, > so shall be!
* Inline Code: I think you should use an `<addr>` element here instead.
