# REST

**1. Who is Roy Fielding?**

Roy Fielding helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the internet, and also did a lot of research explaining why the web works the way it does.

**2. Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?**
Techniques we use today don't work well to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world because they weren't designed to be used like that. Most of the techniques developers used to get computers to talk to each other didn't have those requirements, they only required the ability to talk toa small group of machines.
Machines don't have a universal noun. Every programming language, database, or other kind of system has a different way of talking about nouns.

**3. What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?**

Fielding and his friends created REST, which is an acronym for REpresentational State Transfer.

**4. What does a GET do?**

GET is used to request data from a specified resource.

**5. What does a POST do?**

POST (Power-On Self-Test) is the diagnostic testing sequence that a computer's basic input/output system (or "starting program") runs to determine if the computer keyboard, random access memory, disk drives, and other hardware are working correctly.

**6. What does PUT do?**

PUT is a method used to update resource available on the server. Typically, it replaces whatever exists at the target URL with something else. You can use it to make a new resource or overwrite an existing one.

**7. What does PATCH do?**

A patch is a set of changes to a computer program or its supporting data designed to update, fix, or improve it. This includes fixing security vulnerabilities and other bugs, with such patches usually being called bugfixes or bug fixes.
