# Introduction to React and Components

## Component Based Architecture

* Divides code into smaller sections called components
* Allows users to create reusable snippets of code commonly used in programming
* Code reusability saves time and improves reliability

## What Is A Component?

* A piece of code that executes a particular function or set of functions that can be reused and handled independently

## Component Views

A component can have three different types of views:

1. **Object-Oriented View**
 * Contains a set of collaborating classes 

 * Each class in the component includes all attributes and operations relevant to it's implementation 
 
 * All interfaces that allow the classes to communicate and work together with other design classes must be defined

 * To achieve this, we need to begin with a model of the requirements model and elaborate analysis classes for components that relate to the problem domain 

 2. **Traditional View**

* Exists within the software architecture and serves one of three purposes:
    - A *control component* coordinates the invocation of all of the other problem domain components
    - A *problem domain component* executes a complete of partial function that is requested by the customer
    - An *infrastructure component* is responsible for functions that support processing required in the problem domain

3. **Process-Related View**

* There are two main approaches to process-related views

* Create a new component based on the rules of the 
requirements model

* Or, we can reuse existing software components or design patterns that the software community has created in order to build systems

* These components provide a complete description of their interface and functions they perform which are available to the public 

## Characterisitcs Of Components 

* Versatile- can be reused, replaced, modified, and function independently

## Advantages

* Easy to replace as old versions are updated and newer versions become available

* Third party components reduce cost of development and maintenance

* Components allow development without impacting other parts of the system, ensuring ease of development

* Reusability of components spreads the development and maintenance costs across multiple applications or systems 

* Enhances reliability of the whole system 

* Independency ensures productivity for software developers
