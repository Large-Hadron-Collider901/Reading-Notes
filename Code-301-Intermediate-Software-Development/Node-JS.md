# Pair Programming 
**1. What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?**
Greater efficiency, engaged collaboration, learning from fellow students, social skills, job interview readiness, work environment readiness.
**2. In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?**
I have found pair programming to be the most beneficial for me in the areas of learning from fellow students and engaged collaboration. I love working on projects with peers so that we have each other to bounce ideas off of, it's a great way for me to hear new ideas and approaches that I wouldn't have thought of on my own, and in turn expand my thinking.

**3. How does pair programming work?**

Pair programming usually consists of two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. The Driver role handles the programming side of the project, and should be the only one operating the keyboard. They are responsible for managing the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code. The Navigator guides the Driver using their words, but does not directly add any input to the computer. They are responsible for thinking about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code, as well as scanning for errors. The Navigator can also look up solutions and documentation regarding the project, but should not be writing any code.
